# Crawler

This crawler was made as an exercice. It could certainly be better, and I'll work on it if I have the time.

Objectives contains :
--Make it a service so it can clean stop
--Make it able to remember where it stopped, so that we don't have to try again for each file/folder 
--Make it faster (original attempt was made on 35k files for a total of more than 300G, and after running for 3 days it had only downloaded a third...)
